Development of a modernised version of the old WebMark : WebMark Regenisis.

The motivation for this work comes from several quarters. 
  @ The previous WebMark was written in very old versions of PHP, Javascript and HTML. It is so old, it preceeded CSS. Updating was in order.
  @ There were a number of limitations and strange bugs with the original WebMark.
  @ There was a number improvements that have been suggested but were not implemented as the system was no longer supported.
  @ Blackboard and Canvas have verry limited marking facitiies.
  
The new system uses;
  @ Node js for the back-end along with Maria DB (MySQL) for data storage.
  @ Javascript and Angular for the front-end.
